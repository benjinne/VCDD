<p>Inventories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every room has an inventory, you can think of an inventory as a large shelf with racks, bins, and resistors.</li>
<li>An inventory has a bin capacity and a user remove limit, for the number of resistors in a bin, these are controlled by the administrators.</li>
<li>Rules: There can exist multiple (or 0) inventories in a single room, with unique (or identical) capacities and remove limits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Racks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Racks are sections of an inventory that have tolerance and power ratings for the resistors, these are specified by the administrators.</li>
<li>Racks are like smaller sections of an inventory that contain bins that only fit the specifications of the rack.</li>
<li>Rules: There can exist multiple (or 0) racks in a single inventory, with unique (NOT identical) tolerance and power ratings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bins:</p>
<ol>
<li>Racks are sections of a rack that have resistance and counts associated with them, these are specified by the administrators.</li>
<li>Bins contain the resistors, at this point the resistor has a resistance, tolerance, and power rating associated with it.</li>
<li>Rules: There can exist multiple (or 0) bins in a single rack, with unique (NOT identical) resistance ratings. The user can freely add or remove resistors from the bins as long as they aren't exceeding the remove limits, capacities. All valid transactions will be stored in the transactions table found under the 'Your Profile' tab.</li>
</ol>
